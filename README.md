# Bouncing Ball: Creating a bouncing ball animation with Python (OpenCV) âš½

This repository showcases a creative project I built using **Python** and **OpenCV**:
 + **A lively animation** vid featuring a bouncing ball that playfully interacts with the screen boundaries.
 + **An emoji-enhanced version** of the bouncing ball animation, adding a fun twist with expressive emojis that bring the ball to life.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 1: The Animation Story  
### Description 
The animation brings a playful concept to life as it follows the journey of a ball âš½ bouncing energetically across the screen. It showcases smooth motion, interactions with boundaries, and the joy of movement, adding a fun and captivating visual experience.

## Features
- **Scene Design**: A dynamic ball brought to life with OpenCV functions like `cv2.circle` and `cv2.rectangle` for realistic motion.
- **Smooth Animation**: The ball bounces across the screen with precise boundary interactions using `custom logic`.
- **Emoji Fun**: Enhanced visuals with emojis rendered using PIL for an entertaining twist.
- **Frame Display**: Seamless animation crafted using `cv2.imshow` and `cv2.waitKey` for smooth playback.

## ðŸ”¹ Project 2: The GIF  
### Description

This minimalistic and calming GIF showcases a serene two-tone background, with a tranquil light blue upper section blending into a neutral gray lower section. The simplicity symbolizes balance and a grounded state, perfect for moments of reflection or relaxation.

### Features  
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Mouse-based input to create animations.  
- **GIF Creation**: Frames are looped to simulate a smooth and visually appealing animation.  
- **Key OpenCV Functions**:  
  - `cv2.line`, `cv2.circle` for drawing shapes.  
  - `cv2.putText` for adding text to frames.  
  - `cv2.imshow`, `cv2.waitKey` for frame-by-frame visualization.
